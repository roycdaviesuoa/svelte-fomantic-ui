<h3 class="document-header">Svelte Fomantic UI unit Tests</h3>
<div class="document-description">
    Here are various tests to check that the Svelte versions look the same as the Fomantic-UI examples.  These are also useful as code examples.
    The ones that have links have been worked through, but the ones without links are still being tested and documented.
    They may work fine as they follow the same pattern of implementation as the others, but use at your own risk.
    Note that the Modules, and some of the Inputs require jquery.  If you don't want jquery in your project, then those
    elements won't work, but pretty much all the style-based UI elements still work fine.
