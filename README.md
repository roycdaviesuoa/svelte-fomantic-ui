## This is very much a work in progress, and is not suitable yet for using in any project as fundamental changes will occur...
## If you are interested in the project, feel free to download, assess, and give me frank feedback...

A simple Svelte wrapper for Fomantic UI.  This is a very shallow and light layer on top of the standard fomantic UI as found at https://fomantic-ui.com.

For more details, look inside the svelte-fomantic-ui folder, and in particular, check the [README](./src/README.md)

The source code is found in the folder `src/lib/fomantic-ui`.  You can use the Core.svelte file for including the necessary elements in your project.
There are some examples and tests in the `src/lib/fomantic-ui-tests`.  You can actually run these as a simple project using `yarn dev`, and certianly look at the code for inspiration.
